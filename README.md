# Alias git vangchur 

Just another stupid project I have created for experiment purposes....

## Installation

Note::: Only works on MACOS and LINUX!!!! Windows Sucks!!!
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alamhamim/vangchur_git/main/install.sh)

```

## Uninstall
Depending on what are you are using, if you are using mac it will most likely .zshrc
Run below command:::

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

And look for the alias git_vangchur='....'

Then remove the line. 

Note::: Same thing goes for the linux (.bashrc || .bash_profile)






# Thank You!!!
